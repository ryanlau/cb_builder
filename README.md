# cb_builder
more codingbat less making files and folders

the easiest and fastest way that I know of to add these files and folders to your repo is:
```bash
somewhere/outside/workrepo$ git clone git@github.com:ryanlau/cb_builder.git
somewhere/outside/workrepo$ cp -r cb_builder/string-1 path/to/workrepo/cb
somewhere/outside/workrepo$ cp -r cb_builder/string-2 path/to/workrepo/cb 
```

files and folders are generated with main.py, the code is not elegant but it works
